## Installation
`git clone`
`cd atack-marketing`
`yarn install`

- Download Package from the Repository
- Create Appsettings.json and fill out your SQL Server Connection Information (sample in appsettings-sample.json), if you haven't created a Database in SQL now would be a good time to do so as you will need the DB name
- In Startup.cs under the section labelled "Google Authentication" fill in the "App Name" for options.Authority, ValidIssuer, and ValidAudience
- Open package console and run the command "Update-Database" to provision your SQL DB
- You may now run the API either locally or publish it to a web service like Azure, however make sure your SQL Server can be reached by your hosting provider
